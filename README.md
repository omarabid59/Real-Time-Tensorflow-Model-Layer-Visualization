# Real-Time-Tensorflow-Model-Layer-Visualization
This presents sample code to visualize some of the layers of a model loaded into tensorflow. We describe the process of choosing these layers and displaying them to screen.

## Overview
The image on the left hand side shows the output of the SSD network with the implementation found (**insert link**). The image on the right hand side shows the real time visualization of the layers as the system
